Due to COVID, I am taking some time off from school to work as a research assistant in the Department of Biostatistics, Epidemiology, and Informatics at the University of Pennsylvanniaâ€™s Perelman School of Medicine. I hope to pursue a graduate degree in biostatistics after completing my undergraduate studies at Grinnell.\nThis website contains my personal blog, the prncipal component, where I occasionally throw my thoughts on interesting applications of statistics in science, sports, and more. Hopefully, it will have some links to published research that I have contributed to soon!\nYou can reach me on twitter @jyang29 or via email at yangjasp@grinnell.edu. Thanks for visiting!\n\n\n\n",
