It is no secret that the United States has an ugly history of racial disparities in health outcomes. While some might argue that our nation has made significant progress in this realm, [evidence](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK425844/) has shown that the factors underlying these inequities are so deeply ingrained in our society that we have barely reached their surface. So as COVID-19 makes its way to the top of America’s [leading causes of death list](https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2020/04/16/coronavirus-leading-cause-death/?arc404=true), it is no surprise that communities of color are being impacted at a higher rate. Still, data detailing the racial differences in testing, cases, and deaths is scarce. But why? And what do we know so far?

## Where is the data?

The CDC released its first COVID-19 report including breakdown of cases by race on April 17th, and it only contained racial data for 25% of [cases](https://apnews.com/8a3430dd37e7c44290c7621f5af96d6b). As of April 21st, they have racial data available for less than 40% of reported [deaths](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid_weekly/) from COVID-19. The primary reason for this gap in data is the federal system’s reliance on cause of death codes from registered death certificates. Remarkably, a code specifically for COVID-19 was not added until [March 24th](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvss/coronavirus/Alert-2-New-ICD-code-introduced-for-COVID-19-deaths.pdf), when the total recorded number of cases in the U.S. was already above 54,000. This, combined with the lags in reporting and processing of data, makes the federal numbers quite unreliable when it comes to demographics. 

While federal data lags far behind the action on the ground, many states and counties are publishing their own data in a much timelier fashion. According to [John Hopkins University](https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/data/racial-data-transparency), 35 states are now reporting racial data on confirmed COVID-19 cases. Of those, 29 states are also reporting it for deaths, but only Illinois and Kansas have released racial data for tests. These numbers aren’t great, but they are much better than anything we had a few weeks ago. [APM research lab](https://www.apmresearchlab.org/covid/deaths-by-race) estimates that we now have data about race for 60% of Coronavirus deaths in the United States. Still, it is currently only available on a state-by-state basis. The [COVID Tracking Project](https://covidtracking.com/race) is working on a racial data tracker that should make the data easier to work with, but they expect it to be a couple of weeks before it is ready.

## What do we know so far?

We know with certainty that blacks in particular are being disproportionately affected by  COVID-19 in the United States. The evidence for this is already so convincing that Donald Trump even [admitted](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-vice-president-pence-members-coronavirus-task-force-press-briefing-april-7-2020/) something needed to be done about it. At a national level, the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid_weekly/) reports that blacks, who made up 12.8% of the U.S. population [in 2018](https://wonder.cdc.gov/Single-Race-v2018.html), accounted for 19.9% of the official COVID deaths as of April 21st. While this is a notable difference, the last section discussed why this federal data might not be too reliable. Let’s now take a look at some more reliable numbers from the states that have been hit the hardest:

This chart illustrates a striking pattern in the state-by-state data so far: blacks are being disproportionately killed by COVID-19, and it's not even close. The states typically report these numbers with an asterisk indicating that the data is incomplete. While this is true, most are reporting racial data on well over 75% deaths. The patterns are clear. Looking even closer at some of the cities that have been hardest by COVID-19, the same frightening trends hold.

Given the long history of inequitable health outcomes in the United States, these findings should hardly come as a surprise. But that doesn’t make them any less horrifying. This is convincing evidence that something needs to change right now in the way we deal with the COVID crisis and the ways in which we approach public health in America. 

## The Causes

This section could be a book, and there are definitely hundreds of books out there on this specific topic. I won’t go into any detail because I can’t even fully grasp, let alone try to summarize, how ingrained these causes are in our society, policies, and institutions. I encourage further reading. 

I will, however, make one point on this topic. The CDC explicitly states on their COVID demographic data home page that the deaths from the virus are concentrated in specific regions of the U.S. that do not reflect the racial distribution of the nation as a whole, and the distribution of deaths should therefore not be compared to the racial distribution of the U.S. population when determining if certain subgroups are being affected disproportionately. The first part of that statement is certainly true, but the second part is boderlining absurdity. We have seen crystal clear evidence that the virus spreads most viciously in places where people live in close quarters, can’t afford to social distance, and have environmental hazards that cause pre-existing conditions. We have also seen crystal clear evidence that these places (which include but are not limited to inner cities and prisons) are disproportionately non-white. It is absurd for the CDC to ask us to ignore these facts. The disproportionate distribution of COVID cases needs to be compared to racial distribution of the U.S. population because it highlights the deep-rooted racism in our health system. The fact that people of color are concentrated in the places most vulnerable to infectious disease is not a coincidence.

## Other Disparities

While pressure on states to collect and publish data on the racial burden of COVID-19 has been steadily mounting, other important sources of inequity have received noticeably less attention.  Health disparities exist across many dimensions including sexual orientation, gender identity, disability status, and socioeconomic status. It’s hard to know if we will ever get data on these factors, but they would undoubtedly reveal deeper insights into the social determinants of COVID outcomes.
