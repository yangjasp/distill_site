My name is Jasper Yang and I recently graduated from Grinnell College where I studied biology and statistics. I am currently working as a research assistant in the [Shaw Lab](https://shawstat.org/) at Kaiser Permanente Washington Health Research Institute and plan to enroll in a biostatistics PhD program soon.

My primary research interests are in electronic health records (EHR), Bayesian inference, comparative effectiveness, and precision medicine. I am also interested in rationality, decision theory, and the philosophy of science, which are all intertwined with principles of statistics. These interests are diverse, but they are all grounded in one central question: how can we use data to improve patient health outcomes in the modern age of medicine?

Recently, I have conducted research projects analyzing the determinants of COVID-19 hospital outcomes in the University of Pennsylvania Health System and developing software for efficient multi-wave sampling under two-phase designs. I have also been involved in the statistical analysis for multiple clinical trials. Outside of the classroom, I enjoy playing any sport from soccer to baseball, travelling, and biking. I am a diehard Boston sports fan, and I like to say that my love for statistics grew out of studying Major League Baseball statistics as a kid.

This website contains my personal blog, where I occasionally post about interesting applications of statistics in science, philosophy, sports, and more. It also contains links to some of my published and hopefully-soon-to-be-published work!
