My name is Jasper Yang and I am an undergraduate at Grinnell College majoring in biology with a concentration in statistics. Due to COVID, I am taking some time off from school to work as a research assistant in the Department of Biostatistics, Epidemiology, and Informatics at the University of Pennsylvannia's Perelman School of Medicine. I hope to pursue a graduate degree in biostatistics after completing my undergraduate studies at Grinnell.

jj <- jpeg::readJPEG("/Users/jasper/Desktop/SummerWork2020/distill_site/docs/images/jasperphoto.jpg",native=TRUE)
plot(0:1,0:1,type="n",ann=FALSE,axes=FALSE)
rasterImage(jj,0,0,1,1)
```

This website contains my personal blog, where I occasionally throw my thoughts on interesting applications of statistics in science, sports, and more. Hopefully, it will have some links to published research that I have contributed to soon!
